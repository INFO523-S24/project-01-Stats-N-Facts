| additional_monitoring                       | logical   | when true, the medicine is under additional monitoring, meaning that it is monitored even more intensively than other medicines                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| generic                                     | logical   | whether the drug is a generic medicine, which is developed to be the same as a medicine that has already been authorised, called the reference medicine. A generic medicine contains the same active substance(s) as the reference medicine, and is used at the same dose(s) to treat the same disease(s)                                             |
| biosimilar                                  | logical   | whether the drug is a biosimilar medicine, which is a biological medicine highly similar to another already approved biological medicine called the reference medicine.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| conditional_approval                        | logical   | whether the medicine received a conditional marketing authorisation. This was granted in the interest of public health because the medicine addresses an unmet medical need and the benefit of immediate availability outweighs the risk from less comprehensive data than normally required.                                                         |
| exceptional_circumstances                   | logical   | whether the medicine was authorised under exceptional circumstances, because the applicant was unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of the medicine under normal conditions of use. This can happen because the condition to be treated is rare or because collection of full information is not possible or is unethical. |
| accelerated_assessment                      | logical   | whether the medicine had an accelerated assessment. This means that it is a medicine of major interest for public health, so its timeframe for review was 150 evaluation days rather than 210.                                                                                                                                                        |
| orphan_medicine                             | logical   | whether the medicine was designated an orphan medicine. This means that it was developed for use against a rare, life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition or, for economic reasons, it would be unlikely to have been developed without incentives.                                                                                     |
