In the first step, the dataset is meticulously prepared by handling missing values, excluding vaccines with conditions, and filtering for COVID vaccines. Next, a customized bar plot is used to visualize the top 5 vaccines with the highest revision numbers. In this method, a focus is placed on relevant vaccines that have stable authorizations and notable revision histories, thereby ensuring a comprehensive analysis.\n",

        "- A balance is struck between data preparation and effective visualization during data analysis. Filtering and sorting refine the data, while the bar plot illustrates how the top vaccine revision numbers have changed over time.
