It encompasses diverse information, including the medicine’s category, name, therapeutic area, common name, active substance, and unique product number. Additionally, details about patient safety, authorization status, ATC code, and whether additional monitoring or conditional approval is required are included. The dataset captures essential regulatory information, such as the marketing authorization date, refusal date, and the company holding the marketing authorization. With variables indicating generic status, biosimilarity, orphan medicine designation, and accelerated assessment, the dataset offers a rich source for exploring the landscape of pharmaceutical products. Alongside pharmacotherapeutic group information, details about the indication for specific conditions, target species, and revision history provide a holistic view. The dataset’s diverse nature, coupled with numerical, categorical, and date variables, makes it a valuable resource for conducting analyses in the fields of pharmaceutical research, healthcare, and regulatory affairs.\nDataset Provenance:\nSource: The dataset comes from the TidyTuesday project, specifically the week of March 14, 2023. The data is hosted on GitHub in the TidyTuesday repository.\nURL: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-03-14/readme.md\nDataset Dimensions:\nNumber of Rows (Observations): 1988\nNumber of Columns (Features): 28\nReasons of choosing the dataset:\nThe dataset covers a wide range of drug applications, providing a holistic view of the European drug development landscape. This includes both successful and unsuccessful applications, offering a complete picture of the regulatory environment. Data from the European Medicines Agency is highly reliable, as it is collected and maintained by an authoritative regulatory body. This ensures the accuracy of our analysis.\nUnderstanding how drug development has evolved over time, including which areas (therapeutic, disease focus) are gaining attention. Identifying the success rate of drug applications, which can offer insights into regulatory challenges or the quality of drug development. We’ll gain experience in managing large datasets, including cleaning, filtering, and organizing data to prepare it for analysis. This is a fundamental skill in data science. The dataset provides an opportunity to apply different techniques to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in drug development and approval processes."
