    "text": "Introduction\n\nThe evolution of drug development over time, including therapeutic and disease areas are gaining attention. This shift is driven by changing needs of the population, increasing scientific knowledge, and advances in technology.\nDrug development has become more focused on targeted therapies and personalized treatments, as well as more holistic approaches that target the underlying disease processes. The dataset of interest was collected by the European Medicines Agency. A comprehensive list of medicines is provided, including their categories, names, therapeutic areas, common names, active substances, and unique product numbers. This dataset contains 1988 rows and 28 columns, and its diverse nature, comprising numerical, categorical, and date variables, makes it an invaluable resource for pharmaceutical research, medical care, and government regulation."

    "text": "Approach\n\nTwo-step approach is used to determine which COVID vaccines have undergone the most revisions while maintaining approval status without conditions. In the first step, the dataset is meticulously prepared by handling missing values, excluding vaccines with conditions, and filtering for COVID vaccines. Next, a customized bar plot is used to visualize the top 5 vaccines with the highest revision numbers. In this method, a focus is placed on relevant vaccines that have stable authorizations and notable revision histories, thereby ensuring a comprehensive analysis.\nA balance is struck between data preparation and effective visualization during data analysis. Filtering and sorting refine the data, while the bar plot illustrates how the top vaccine revision numbers have changed over time. With these two approaches combined, vaccine revisions can be effectively addressed in the context of authorization status and absence of conditions."
