    "text": "Question1\nWhich COVID vaccines have undergone the most revisions while maintaining an approved authorization status with no conditions applied?\n\nIntroduction\nIn the dynamic landscape of pharmaceutical development, the ongoing refinement and adaptation of COVID vaccines are of paramount importance. As the global community grapples with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory bodies continuously monitor and update the authorization details of vaccines to ensure their efficacy, safety, and adherence to evolving standards. Question 1 of this analysis aims to unravel the intricacies of COVID vaccine development by investigating which vaccines have undergone the most revisions while maintaining an approved authorization status with no applied conditions.\nThis inquiry is particularly pertinent in understanding the regulatory response to emerging variants, evolving scientific knowledge, and the pursuit of continuous improvement in vaccine formulations. By focusing on variables such as medicine name, therapeutic area, authorization status, revision number, and conditional approval, the analysis aims to provide insights into the resilience and adaptability of COVID vaccines in the face of ongoing challenges. Through a meticulous examination of the dataset, we aim to identify patterns and trends that shed light on the regulatory landscape surrounding COVID vaccine development in the European context.\n\n\nApproach\nThe strategy to uncover COVID vaccines with the most revisions while maintaining approved authorization status and devoid of applied conditions involves a systematic process of data preparation, filtering, and visualization. Beginning with imputation to handle null values in the ‘therapeutic_area’ column, the dataset is refined by filtering out drugs related to COVID, creating a specialized subset focused on vaccines for the virus. Subsequent steps include the filtration of the dataset to exclusively include authorized medicines and sorting based on ‘revision_number’ in descending order. This sequential arrangement positions vaccines with the highest revision numbers at the forefront, providing valuable insights into their dynamic regulatory trajectory.\nFollowing data preparation and sorting, the extraction of pertinent columns (‘medicine_name’, ‘revision_number’, ‘therapeutic_area’) lays the groundwork for a visually impactful bar plot. This visualization method, chosen for its clarity and interpretability, showcases the top 5 COVID vaccines with the most revisions. The use of color in the plot not only enhances visual appeal but also aids in distinguishing between different vaccines. By amalgamating imputation, filtering, sorting, and visualization techniques, this approach facilitates a comprehensive exploration, offering a nuanced understanding of the regulatory nuances and adaptations of these critical COVID vaccines.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\nCode\n# Replace null values with empty string in 'therapeutic_area' column\ndrugs['therapeutic_area'].fillna('', inplace=True)\n\n# Filter COVID vaccines based on 'therapeutic_area'\ncovid_vaccines = drugs[drugs['therapeutic_area'].str.contains('COVID', case=False)]\n\n# Exclude medicines with conditions applied\ncovid_vaccines = covid_vaccines[~covid_vaccines['conditional_approval']]\n\n# Filter the dataset to include only authorised medicines\ncovid_vaccines = covid_vaccines[covid_vaccines['authorisation_status'] == 'authorised']\n\n# Sort the dataset based on 'revision_number' in descending order\ncovid_vaccines_sorted = covid_vaccines.sort_values(by='revision_number', ascending=False)\n\n# Extract relevant columns ('medicine_name' and 'revision_number')\nvaccine_revisions = covid_vaccines_sorted[['revision_number', 'medicine_name', 'therapeutic_area']]\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Top-10 data\nmedicine_names = vaccine_revisions['medicine_name'][:10]\nrevision_numbers = vaccine_revisions['revision_number'][:10]\n\n# Remove content within parentheses\nmedicine_names = [re.sub(r'\\([^()]*\\)', '', name).strip() for name in medicine_names]\n\n# Create a figure and axis object\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))\n\n# Create bar plot\nbars = ax.bar(medicine_names, revision_numbers, color='skyblue')\n\n# Set labels and title with customized font\nlabel_font = {'fontsize': 12, 'fontweight': 'bold'}\ntitle_font = {'fontsize': 16, 'fontweight': 'bold'}\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('Medicine Name', fontdict=label_font)\nax.set_ylabel('Revision Number', fontdict=label_font)\nax.set_title('\\n Top 10 COVID vaccines that have undergone the most revisions \\n', fontdict=title_font)\n\n# Wrap long medicine names into two lines\nwrapped_names = [textwrap.fill(name, width = 25) for name in medicine_names]\n\n# Set tick labels with line breaks\nax.set_xticklabels(wrapped_names, rotation = 30, ha='center')\n\n# Show plot\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe dynamic regulatory environment guiding vaccine production has become more apparent as a result of the preprocessing and subsequent visualization of COVID vaccination data. RoActemra has undergone an astounding 40 revisions out of the top 5 vaccines with the most while still having an official authorization status. This indicates that the vaccine is still being researched and refined in its application for severe COVID-19 cases. Pfizer-BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine Comirnaty, which has undergone 38 revisions, comes in second, showing how carefully the process was followed to adjust to new variations and enhance vaccination efficacy. In a similar vein, Spikevax—previously known as Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine—with its 35 changes highlights the cooperative efforts of regulators and manufacturers to guarantee continued safety and efficacy in the face of changing scientific knowledge.\nThese results highlight the iterative process involved in developing vaccines and the proactive approach taken by regulatory bodies in tackling new issues. The substantial amount of changes made to these top vaccines shows a dedication to ongoing adaptation and enhancement in the face of a quickly changing pandemic environment. Sustaining the efficacy of COVID vaccination campaigns and ultimately halting the virus’s spread would need constant watchfulness and adaptability as research progresses and new strains appear."

The critical sorting step organizes the dataset based on the ‘revision_date’ in descending order, spotlighting the most recent releases and enabling a chronological understanding of advancements in Hepatitis B medication.\nFollowing the data preparation steps, the approach shifts to visualization, employing a table representation to succinctly convey detailed information about the most recent Hepatitis B medicines. This choice is driven by the need for precision and efficiency in presenting key details such as medicine name, marketing authorization holder company, and revision date. The custom table incorporates color mapping, utilizing skyblue for column headers to enhance visual appeal and facilitate quick identification of crucial information. This dual-method approach, blending filtering and color-enhanced table representation, not only uncovers the latest developments in Hepatitis B medication but also ensures a visually accessible and comprehensive presentation of the information.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\nCode\n# Replace null values with empty string in 'therapeutic_area' column\ndrugs['therapeutic_area'].fillna('', inplace=True)\n\n# Filter the dataset to include only medicines related to 'Hepatitis B' in the 'therapeutic_area' variable\nhepatitis_b_medicines = drugs[drugs['therapeutic_area'].str.contains('Hepatitis B', case=False)]\n\n# Filter the dataset to include only medicines for humans in the 'category' variable\nhuman_hepatitis_b_medicines = hepatitis_b_medicines[hepatitis_b_medicines['category'] == 'human']\n\n# Filter the dataset to include only authorised medicines\nauthorised_hepatitis_b_medicines = human_hepatitis_b_medicines[human_hepatitis_b_medicines['authorisation_status'] == 'authorised']\n\n# Sort the dataset based on the 'revision_date' in descending order to get the most recently revised medicines\nrecently_revised_medicines = authorised_hepatitis_b_medicines.sort_values(by='revision_date', ascending=False)\n\n# Extract and display the relevant columns ('medicine_name' and 'marketing_authorisation_holder_company_name') for the most recently revised medicines\ntop_5_result = recently_revised_medicines[['medicine_name', 'marketing_authorisation_holder_company_name', 'revision_date']].head(5)\n\n# Extract only the date part using string operations\ntop_5_result['revision_date'] = top_5_result['revision_date'].str[:10]\n\n#print(top_5_result)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Custom column labels\ncustom_col_labels = ['Medicine Name', 'Company Name', 'Revision Date']\n\n# Draw a table to display the result\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 2.5))\ntable = plt.table(cellText=top_5_result.values,\n                  colLabels=custom_col_labels,\n                  loc='center',\n                  cellLoc='center',\n                  colColours=['skyblue']*len(top_5_result.columns),\n                  cellColours=[['lightgrey']*len(top_5_result.columns)]*len(top_5_result),\n                  fontsize=10)\n\ntable.auto_set_font_size(False)\ntable.set_fontsize(10)\ntable.scale(1, 1.5)  # Adjust the scale to make the table more compact\nplt.axis('off')  # Turn off axis\nplt.title('Most recently released Hepatitis B medicines \\n authorized for human usage', fontdict={'fontsize': 14, 'fontweight': 'bold'})\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# List of specific Hepatitis B medicines from the drugs dataset\nspecific_medicines = [\n    'Baraclude',\n    'Entecavir Accord',\n    'Entecavir Mylan',\n    'Hepsera',\n    'Heplisav B',\n    'Lamivudine Teva',\n    'Sebivo',\n    'Vemlidy',\n    'Viread',\n    'Zeffix'\n]\n\n# Filter for rows where 'medicine_name' is in the list of specific medicines\nfiltered_hepB_drugs = drugs[drugs['medicine_name'].isin(specific_medicines)]\n\n# Convert 'revision_date' to datetime \nfiltered_hepB_drugs['revision_date'] = pd.to_datetime(filtered_hepB_drugs['revision_date'])\n\n# Ensure the data is sorted by 'revision_date'\nfiltered_hepB_drugs = filtered_hepB_drugs.sort_values('revision_date')\n\n# Pivot table to reshape the DataFrame for plotting\npivot_df_filtered = filtered_hepB_drugs.pivot_table(index = 'revision_date', columns = 'medicine_name', values = 'revision_number', aggfunc = 'sum', fill_value = 0)\n\n# Cumulative sum for each medicine to get cumulative revisions over time\ncumulative_revisions_filtered = pivot_df_filtered.cumsum()\n\n# Plotting\nplt.figure(figsize = (8, 5))\nplt.stackplot(cumulative_revisions_filtered.index, cumulative_revisions_filtered.T, labels=cumulative_revisions_filtered.columns, alpha = 0.5)\n\n# Adding labels and title\nplt.title('Cumulative Revisions of Selected Hepatitis B Medicines Over Time')\nplt.xlabel('Months in 2021-2022')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Revisions')\nplt.legend(loc = 'upper left', fontsize = 'small')\nplt.tight_layout()  \n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nWhile we examined the data, some interesting and fascinating developments in the filed of Hepatitis B therapy got our attention. For the people afflicted with this illness, it is seen that some few new medications has been licensed for the use of humans. For instance, Vaxelis, that was approved by MCM Vaccine B.V. on the February 20, 2023, gives out hopes and promises as an enhanced vaccination option against diseases, including Hepatitis B. This implies that efforts to further improve the efficacy of immunization programs should continue.\nNext are Hexacima and Hexyon, which Sanofi Pasteur authorized on January 6, 2023. These vaccinations are combo shots that offer more protection overall, especially against Hepatitis B. It’s wonderful to see businesses like Sanofi Pasteur stepping up to provide thorough answers to such difficult medical problems. Furthermore, new oral antiviral medications such as Lamivudine from Teva and Viread from Gilead Sciences Ireland UC, which were both licensed in late 2022 and early 2023, demonstrate that several approaches are being investigated for the management of Hepatitis B. The fact that this disease is being combatted on several fronts is encouraging and gives sufferers hope for improved results."
